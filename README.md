# Algorithm Checkpoint 1

This project contains algorithms written in a custom algorithmic language. The main file is `index.algo`, which processes a sentence to count its length, the number of words, and the number of vowels.

## Files

- `index.algo`: Main algorithm file that reads a sentence and calculates its length, word count, and vowel count.

## Usage

1. Open the `.algo` file in your preferred IDE or text editor.
2. Follow the instructions in the comments to understand the purpose of the algorithm.
3. Run the algorithm using the appropriate interpreter or compiler for the custom algorithmic language.

## Algorithm

### `index.algo`

This algorithm reads a sentence from the user and calculates:
- The length of the sentence (excluding the period).
- The number of words in the sentence.
- The number of vowels in the sentence.
